# üì• Bulk Dropbox Image Downloader and OCR-Based Sorting

## üìù About this Project

This project automates downloading, extracting, and organizing movie images from Dropbox links listed in an Excel file. It streamlines image sourcing workflows for inflight entertainment content management.

The script downloads ZIP archives, extracts images, uses OCR to detect multilingual text for poster identification, and sorts images into folders by movie title, reducing manual work.
